# Bayesian Networks in Financial Modeling

A comprehensive exploration of probabilistic graphical models for financial analysis, risk assessment, and investment decision-making under uncertainty.

## üè¶ Overview

Bayesian Networks offer powerful tools for financial modeling by capturing complex dependencies between market variables and enabling probabilistic reasoning about financial outcomes. These methods are well-accepted and time-tested, providing valuable insights when applied properly to financial forecasting and analysis .

This repository demonstrates how Bayesian networks can be leveraged for various financial applications, from portfolio optimization to systemic risk assessment

## üéØ Key Applications in Finance

#### **Portfolio Risk and Return Modeling**
- **Asset Correlation Modeling**: Capturing dependencies between different asset classes
- **Risk Factor Analysis**: Understanding how macroeconomic factors influence portfolio performance
- **Diversification Optimization**: Quantifying correlation benefits in portfolio construction
- **Value-at-Risk (VaR) Estimation**: Probabilistic assessment of potential losses

#### **Market Analysis and Signal Detection**
Bayesian networks serve as quantitative financial tools for market signals detection by combining and incorporating different types and sources of market information . Applications include:

- **Technical Indicator Integration**: Combining multiple technical signals with probabilistic weights
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Incorporating news sentiment and market psychology factors
- **Regime Detection**: Identifying market state transitions (bull/bear markets, volatility regimes)
- **Trading Strategy Development**: Building probabilistic trading rules based on multiple indicators

#### **Credit Risk Assessment**
- **Default Probability Modeling**: Assessing borrower creditworthiness using multiple risk factors
- **Counterparty Risk Analysis**: Evaluating interconnected credit exposures
- **Stress Testing**: Simulating adverse scenarios and their impact on credit portfolios
- **Regulatory Capital Calculation**: Supporting Basel III and other regulatory frameworks

#### **Systemic Risk Assessment**
Bayesian methodology enables systemic risk assessment in financial networks such as the interbank market, where nodes represent participants and weighted directed edges represent financial relationships .

## üßÆ Core Financial Models Implemented

#### **1. Multi-Factor Asset Pricing Model**
```python
# Example network structure
factors = ['Market_Return', 'Interest_Rate', 'Inflation', 'GDP_Growth']
assets = ['Stock_A', 'Stock_B', 'Bond_C', 'Commodity_D']
portfolio_return = 'Portfolio_Performance'

# CPD incorporates factor sensitivities (betas)
P(Asset_Return | Factors) = f(factor_loadings, idiosyncratic_risk)
```

#### **2. Credit Contagion Network**
```python
# Modeling interconnected financial institutions
institutions = ['Bank_A', 'Bank_B', 'Insurance_C', 'Hedge_Fund_D']
macro_factors = ['Recession', 'Interest_Shock', 'Market_Crash']

# Default dependencies through network connections
P(Default_i | Default_j, Macro_State, Exposure_ij)
```

#### **3. Options Pricing Under Uncertainty**
```python
# Bayesian approach to option valuation
market_variables = ['Stock_Price', 'Volatility', 'Interest_Rate']
option_value = 'Call_Option_Price'

# Incorporating parameter uncertainty in Black-Scholes
P(Option_Price | Market_Variables, Model_Parameters)
```
