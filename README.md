# Bayesian Network Inference

A comprehensive implementation and exploration of inference algorithms for Bayesian Networks, providing tools for probabilistic reasoning and decision making under uncertainty.

## üîç What are Bayesian Networks?

Bayesian Networks are probabilistic graphical models that represent a set of variables and their conditional dependencies via a directed acyclic graph (DAG). They provide a compact representation of joint probability distributions and enable efficient probabilistic inference üß† Inference Methods Implemented

This repository explores various inference techniques for Bayesian networks:

#### **Exact Inference**
- **Variable Elimination**: Systematic elimination of variables to compute marginal probabilities
- **Junction Tree Algorithm**: Efficient exact inference using tree decomposition
- **Inference by Enumeration**: Direct computation of probabilities by summing over all possible assignments **Approximate Inference**
- **Monte Carlo Sampling**: Statistical sampling methods for probability estimation
- **Belief Propagation**: Message passing algorithms for approximate inference
- **Variational Methods**: Optimization-based approaches for posterior approximation

#### **Query Types Supported**
- **Marginal Queries**: Computing P(X) for any variable X
- **Conditional Queries**: Computing P(X|E) given evidence E **Joint Distributions**: Computing probabilities over multiple variables **Most Probable Explanation (MPE)**: Finding the most likely assignment to all variables

## üöÄ Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bayesian-network-inference.git
cd bayesian-network-inference
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üíª Quick Start

```python
from bayesian_network import BayesianNetwork
from inference import VariableElimination

# Create a simple Bayesian network
bn = BayesianNetwork()
bn.add_node('Rain', ['Yes', 'No'])
bn.add_node('Sprinkler', ['On', 'Off'])
bn.add_node('Grass_Wet', ['Wet', 'Dry'])

# Add conditional dependencies
bn.add_edge('Rain', 'Grass_Wet')
bn.add_edge('Sprinkler', 'Grass_Wet')

# Perform inference
inference_engine = VariableElimination(bn)
result = inference_engine.query(['Grass_Wet'], evidence={'Rain': 'Yes'})
print(f"P(Grass_Wet|Rain=Yes) = {result}")
```

## üìä Features

- **Interactive Visualization**: Graph visualization tools for network structure **Multiple File Formats**: Support for loading models from various file formats
- **Soft Evidence**: Handle uncertain or probabilistic evidence **Performance Optimization**: Efficient algorithms for large networks

## üîß Supported Operations

#### **Model Construction**
- Manual network construction with CPD specification

- GUI-based model creation tools

#### **Inference Queries**
```python
# Marginal probability
P_rain = inference.marginal(['Rain'])

# Conditional probability  
P_grass_given_rain = inference.query(['Grass_Wet'], evidence={'Rain': 'Yes'})

# Joint probability
P_joint = inference.joint(['Rain', 'Sprinkler'])

# Most probable explanation
mpe = inference.mpe(evidence={'Grass_Wet': 'Wet'})
```
